8/16/23- Yesterday John drove and we built out the database, he figured out how to get the docker containers running since we couldn't figure that out on the 15th when Jean was driving in the afternoon. I drove in the morning of the 15th and built out some models, I think they'll need to be changed. I also believe that we'll need additional models. Yesterday we also selected issues we wanted to tackle so that was great.

8/21/23- Over the weekend I spent time looking into the documentation for the Places API. Today I made a branch for the Places API and will be working on adding relavent code to the branch to test it.
